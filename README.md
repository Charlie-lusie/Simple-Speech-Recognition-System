# Speech-Recognize
A simple Speech Recognize Code based on MFCC and DTW in Windows platform.

The Win32Project.zip is a collection of project files. Unzip it and put the files inside into a new created folder, so do other files.
And, AU.bmp,c.bmp,e.gif,title.bmp,VO.bmp should be put in the root directory of your D disk(D:\\).

This Project, which can recognize the speaker by his/her voice(a setted sentence:'西安交通大学'), is created in C, and comfiled by Visual Stdio. The main language of its interface is Chinese. It is for our Digital Signal Processing class, so maybe too crude for you. 

But I still hope you can be interested in it.:-)
